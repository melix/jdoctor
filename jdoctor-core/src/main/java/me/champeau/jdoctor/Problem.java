/**
 * <p>This interface represents the model of a problem which needs to be reported to a user.
 * A problem must:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>be associated with a {@link #getSeverity() severity} (e.g, critical, warning, deprecation, ...)</li>
 *     <li>have a unique {@link #getId() ID} </li>
 *     <li>have a {@link #getWhere() location}, represented by its "context"</li>
 *     <li>have a {@link #getWhat() short description} ("what happened")</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, it is strongly recommended that problems carry:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>a description of {@link #getWhy() why} the problem happened</li>
 *     <li>a {@link #getLongDescription() longer description} of the problem</li>
 *     <li>a link to {@link #getDocumentationLink() documentation} providing throughful explanation of the problem</li>
 *     <li>a list of {@link #getPossibleSolutions() possible solutions to the problem}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each of the solutions, themselves, provide a short and a long description, as well as
 * an optional documentation link.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is expected that different problem categories are represented by different concrete
 * instantiations of this interface, where the generic type representation go away.</p>
 *
 * <p>The problem ID doesn't have to be displayed to the user, but it can be useful. There
 * are often problems which are the same but are expressed differently depending on the
 * context. Therefore, assigning a unique id is a good way to uniquely identify a problem.
 * It can also be useful to put in place mechanisms to silence particular problems (for
 * example, suppress warnings for a specific problem).</p>
 *
 * <p>The combination of (id, context) can also be used to pinpoint a particular problem.</p>
 *
 * <p>As many different projects have a different opinion on what severity levels exist,
 * or what kind of problems we can find, the severity is a generic type argument which
 * should be specified by your application.</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@link StandardSeverity convenience, opiniated, severity enum} is available for use
 * if you need one.</p>
 *
 * @param <ID> an ID enumeration. Each problem should be uniquely identified by ID.
 * @param <SEVERITY> the severity type
 * @param <CONTEXT> the type of the context, representing where the problem happened
